Hi, my name is Kevin Olvera I'm a working Full Stack Developer and love seeing how things work and the different possibilities of how it could have been done. I've worked in a lot of Blue collar jobs from Machinery to working at nuclear and water treatment plants for Industrial Electrical work. Slowly but surely I found programming to be exciting and rewarding and decided to give it my full-time attention and have never been happier with myself with that decision. Working out of class too keep improving my skills and know if I keep at it I will accomplish my goal of becoming a even better software developer.
